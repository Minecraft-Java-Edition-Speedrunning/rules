# **About This Document** {#about-this-document}

## **Outline:** {#outline:}

Rules are divided into 5 sections. These are:

- **Ruleset:** these numbers refer to a specific category or set of categories, such as all Random Seed categories, or specifically Any% Glitchless RSG 1.16+. If the ruleset refers to a specific tab on speedrun.com (ex. Any% Glitchless), it will use a number, while if it refers to a grouping of categories (ex. Random Seed categories), it will use a capital letter.  
- **Section:** these numbers refer to a specific grouping of rules, such as defining a category or video requirements.   
- **Rule:** these numbers refer to the individual rules themselves.  
- **Sub-Rule:** these are clarifiers, explanations, and qualifiers to the attached rule. These are denoted with letters.  
- **Sub-Sub-Rule**: these are clarifiers, explanations, and qualifiers to the attached sub-rules. These are denoted with Roman Numerals.

**Example:**  
Rule A.2.4.c refers to:

- Ruleset A (Universal Ruleset)  
- Section 2 (Videos)  
- Rule 4 (Your video must be viewable.)  
- Sub-Rule c (This excludes but is not limited to…password-protected videos)

**Relevant Rules:**  
A category will abide by all of the rulesets which contain the category. 

For example, take the category All Advancements 1.16 RSG.  
This category will abide by the following rulesets:

- Universal Ruleset (as with all runs)  
- Random Seed Ruleset  
- Glitchless Ruleset  
- All Advancements Ruleset  
- All Advancements SS/RS/SSG/RSG 1.16 Ruleset

Note that the rules should be enforced ‘bottom-up’. In the above example, rules in the All Advancements Ruleset may nullify or extend the rules from the Universal Ruleset.

Some categories may not have a subcategory ruleset (ex. External Set Seed Glitched 1.9+). In these cases, it should still follow the universal ruleset, set seed ruleset, and glitched ruleset, and also be in a version 1.9 or above. 

## **Terminology:**  {#terminology:}

Please refer to [RFC-2119 Requirement Levels](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119) for the explicit definitions of the commands **must, must not, can/may, should/recommended, and should not/not recommended.**

Commands:

- **(at the discretion of verifiers)**: An outcome is subjective: it is therefore at the discretion of the mods and verifiers. This outcome is either brought about collectively or is a judgement that the majority of the mods/verifiers would agree upon.  
- **Open a thread:** Create a thread in the official Discord server by joining [the official Minecraft: Java speedrunning Discord](https://discord.gg/jmdFn3C), clicking the \#help channel, clicking the Create Thread button, then clicking create. This message will then be sent to all moderators and verifiers; in the message, detail the situation which has caused you to open a thread.  
- **\[rule\] is nullified:** A rule does not apply for a specific category or subset of a category

Sub-Rules:

- **Includes/excludes but is not limited to**: the following are an actively growing list of examples of the rule provided for clarity.  
- **Constitutes:** a full list of examples to the rule (only done when possible)  
- **Clarification**: a specific situation of the rule is provided for the runner’s benefit.  
- **Exception**: an exemption from the rule in a given circumstance  
- **Guidance**: explanation of how a runner can abide by said rule   
- **Note:** A section of the rules which explains a general philosophy surrounding a section of the rules, which is useful to provide clarity and context to subjective rules. Notes do not necessarily provide the rationale behind a rule, but rather, an explanation as to how other rules are treated. They are marked in the form A.1.note)  
- **Entangled Rules:** A note provided below rules which other rules refer to/amend/nullify. For instance, if rule Y refers to rule X, then rule Y would contain a link to rule X, while under rule X, the entangled rule tag would be present, saying that rule Y refers to it. Entangled rules are not marked if they are within the same section unless doing so would enhance readability due to the section’s length. There are three types of ways in which a rule can be entangled:  
  - X is referenced by Y; in this instance, rule Y refers to the enforcement of rule X.  
  - X is subject to an amendment by Y; in this instance, rule Y expands upon the allowable actions of rule X.  
  - X is nullified by Y; in this instance, rule Y nullifies rule X (as defined above).

A.3.1) The F3 screen must be shown during or after the run.  
A.3.1.a) If you did not show the F3 screen during the run but did at some point during the recording in the same instance, your video must include the aforementioned part of the recording. Your run may be verified (at the discretion of verifiers).   
A.3.1.b) If you did not show the F3 screen during the run whatsoever, you must send logs following section [A.7.6](#bookmark=id.qfzmymaz6at9). Your run may be verified (at the discretion of verifiers).

## **A.5 Timing Rules**  {#a.5-timing-rules}

Entangled Rule(s):  
A.5 is referenced by: [E.2.2](#bookmark=id.iku5od5nluek).   
A.5 is nullified by: [11.1.2](#bookmark=id.xsssk0kchznv), [CE16.1.4](#bookmark=id.ajzlyert3jva).  
A.5.1) Runs begin timing on either world load, referring to when the player is placed into the world, or on first input.    
A.5.1.a) Clarification: The timing method that is applied is defined by the category, and not chosen by the player.   
A.5.1.b) Guidance: Random seed categories, longer categories, and categories which benefit from waiting additional time are likely (though not always) timed by world load, whereas set seed categories and shorter categories are likely (though not always) timed by first input.  
Entangled Rule(s):  
A.5.1 is referenced by: [F.2.1](#bookmark=id.9pqypm3rw0j)  
A.5.2) First input timing begins when the player begins actions within the world.  
This constitutes:   
A.5.2.a) Moving, both voluntary (ex. pressing keys) and involuntary (ex. pushed by mobs)   
Entangled Rule(s):  
	A.5.2.a is referenced by: [F.2.2.b.i](#bookmark=id.99kgxzo80pz)

A.5.2.c) Inventory opening/switching slots  
A.5.2.d) Sneaking  
A.5.2.e) Jumping  
A.5.2.f) Left click actions (mining, attacking)  
A.5.2.g) Right click actions (placing, opening containers, entering entity UIs)  
A.5.2.h) Exception: If a run waits excessively long (at the discretion of verifiers) in-game without making an input, the time will begin upon world load instead.  
Entangled Rule(s):  
A.5.2 is referenced by: [F.2.1](#bookmark=id.9pqypm3rw0j), [F.2.2.b](#bookmark=id.s7romix9e62z)  
A.5.3) Timing ends once the objective of the category is first achieved.  
A.5.4) Unless otherwise specified, pauses do not contribute towards in-game time.  
	Pauses include but are not limited to:  
	A.5.4.a) The Esc menu  
	A.5.4.b) The F3+Esc menu (“Game Paused”)  
	A.5.4.c) The opening of a book and quill   
	A.5.4.d) The opening of a sign (in Minecraft versions before 1.20)  
	A.5.4.e) The demo GUI opening  
	A.5.4.f) The advancements menu opening  
	A.5.4.g) The confirmation screen upon clicking \[Intentional Game Design\]  
	A.5.4.h) The "Twitch Broadcasting Unavailable" Menu  
A.5.4.i) Clarification: Pressing the Statistics menu causes the game to temporarily advance. This time will be added towards the final time.  
A.5.5) Loading times (the Loading Terrain screen and Joining World screen) do not contribute towards in-game time.  
A.5.6) If lag occurs in the run which causes your game to freeze fully, this time will not contribute towards in-game time.  
A.5.7) If lag occurs, which causes a portion of the game to revert back to a previous state, this time will not contribute towards in-game time.  
A.5.7.a) If a significant portion of the game is reverted back to a previous state (at the discretion of verifiers), the time may contribute towards in-game time.  
A.5.8) If lag occurs in the run, where some actions are impossible to perform while other actions are, the time may or may not contribute towards in-game time (at the discretion of verifiers), depending on if other fundamental processes are still occurring and/or if the action that cannot be performed is crucial to the run.   
A.5.9) If lag slows down the entire run, as is often present within the first few seconds of loading a world in older versions, the extra time will contribute towards in-game time if the run is manually retimed.  
A.5.9.a) Clarification: If this lag occurs and SpeedrunIGT is used, the extra time spent will be accounted for and subtracted from the in-game time.   
A.5.10) If a run is segmented, then time spent between the segments of the run will not contribute to in-game time or the real time of the run.  
A.5.11) If a run meets the criteria for a top-level retime, pauses contribute to in-game time except for the following circumstances:  
A.5.11.a) Pauses that occur directly after or close to after (at the discretion of verifiers) a significant amount of chunks of a dimension are loaded for the first time and do not contribute towards in-game time.   
A.5.11.b) Pauses that change settings and are less than 5 seconds do not contribute to in-game time. If this is done abusively (at the discretion of verifiers), these pauses will contribute towards in-game time.  
A.5.11.c) Pauses that change settings and are more than 5 seconds will have 5 seconds subtracted from the paused time elapsed, with the rest of the pause length contributing towards the in-game time. If this is done abusively (at the discretion of verifiers), the full length of the pause will contribute towards in-game time.  
A.5.11.d) If a pause is done due to a disruption that could not reasonably be avoided (ex. pressing responsibility, medical issue), and the runner identifies and requests that said pause should be removed (either in the run’s speedrun.com submission description or in the thread in the official Discord server), the pause will not contribute towards in-game time (at the discretion of verifiers).   
A.5.11.d.i) Clarification: External program malfunctioning qualifies under this rule (at the discretion of verifiers); user error, however, does not.  
A.5.11.e) If a pause occurs very close (at the discretion of verifiers) to the world load (as a result of the player or macro), the pause will not contribute towards in-game time.   
A.5.11.f) If a pause is done to load chunks that are not loaded due to lag, and the runner identifies and requests that said pause should be removed (either in the run’s speedrun.com submission description or in a thread in the official Discord server), the pause will not contribute towards in-game time (at the discretion of verifiers).   
A.5.12) Top-level retime criteria are said to be met if and only if the in-game time of the run without the top-level retime is under the threshold set.  
A.5.12.a) Example: Suppose a top-level retime for a category has a threshold of thirteen minutes. If the real-time of a run is 13:05, but when all of the pauses, loads, and lag are taken out, the in-game time of the run is 12:58, the run is considered a candidate for a top-level retime. This top-level-retime may increase the run’s in-game time to over thirteen minutes.  
A.5.13) If the run uses SpeedrunIGT, that time will be used as the in-game time.  
A.5.13.a) Exception: This time may be altered and adjusted for lag, top-level retimes, and known mod inaccuracies.  
A.5.13.b) You may use the option only to show 0-2 decimal places, but all 3 decimal places must be submitted for SpeedrunIGT to be used. If all 3 decimal places do not show upon run completion (due to the category not ending on a pause/load and the incorrect SpeedrunIGT category being selected), SpeedrunIGT will be used if and only if you submit world files for the run and leave a note in the speedrun.com submission's descriptions saying you have done so.  
A.5.14) If a run does not use SpeedrunIGT, the run may be retimed manually through use of the video’s frames (at the discretion of verifiers). If you would like this to be the case, you should request this in the run’s speedrun.com submission description or a thread in the official Discord server (this does not guarantee this will occur).   
A.5.15) If a run does not use SpeedrunIGT but does display a timer that uses the playOneMinute statistic to display the in-game time after pauses (ex. Livesplit, Geosquare Timer, Tuxprint Timer) and is not manually retimed, this statistic will be used as the in-game time.  
A.5.16) If a run displays the statistics menu directly or shortly after the run and is not manually retimed, the run’s in-game time may be extrapolated through the value given in the Time Played statistic.   
A.5.17) If a run does not use SpeedRunIGT, is not manually retimed, does not show an in-game timer that uses playOneMinute, and does not show the statistics menu, the real time of the run will be used as the run’s in-game time.  
A.5.18) If a run ends by obtaining item(s), timing ends once one of the following is achieved:  
	A.5.18.a) The item is taken from a non-reversible GUI (ex. furnace or crafting table)  
A.5.18.b) The item appears in an inventory/hotbar slot  
	A.5.18.c) When it can be determined an item is picked up

## **A.6: General Submission Rules** {#a.6:-general-submission-rules}

A.6.1) The run’s speedrun.com submission description must include the seed of the world.  
A.6.1.a) If the run’s seed is not the description but can be reasonably attained, it may be verified (at the discretion of verifiers).   
A.6.2) Mark your run as F3 if it uses the F3 screen during the run, or any feature which is triggered by an F3 hotkey (ex. F3+B hitboxes, F3+H advanced tooltips).  
A.6.2.a) Clarification: Many F3 hotkeys (such as F3+B hitboxes) will carry over between worlds. If these features are enabled, the run will still be considered as using F3 even if the hotkey itself was not pressed during the run.  
A.6.2.b) Clarification: F3+P (pause on lost focus) will mark your run as F3 if it is disabled.  
A.6.2.c) Clarification: F3+Esc (an alternate Game Paused menu) will mark your run as F3 if it is used.  
A.6.2.d) Clarification: If the mod StandardSettings is used and the f3PauseOnWorldLoad setting in the standardoptions.txt file is set to true, your run will be marked as using F3.  
Entangled Rule(s):  
A.6.2 is referenced by: [CE16.2.1](#bookmark=id.6chn165ybxr9), [CE19.4.3](#bookmark=id.hduywpl9byoc), [CE26.1.2.a](#bookmark=id.gey1l18ickm8)  
A.6.3) Mark your run’s difficulty as the lowest difficulty played during the run.  
A.6.4) Mark the mods section of your run in accordance with the mods you used at any point during the run.  
	A.6.4.a) If no mods are used at all, mark your run as Vanilla.  
A.6.4.b) If just Optifine is used (not Fabric Loader), mark your run as Optifine.  
	A.6.4.b.i) Clarification: Optifine may only be used if [A.8.1](#bookmark=id.sfd7fxx1kakg) is followed.  
A.6.4.c) If any other mods are used, including Optifabric or the Fabric Loader, mark your run as Modded.

## **A.7: Additional Proof Submissions** {#a.7:-additional-proof-submissions}

A.7.1) All additional proof should be submitted through the [official Google form.](https://forms.gle/v7oPXfjfi7553jkp7) Additional proof can be submitted in the run’s speedrun.com submission description, but this is not recommended.  
A.7.2) If you submit a run, you agree to send the game moderators extra proof (in particular but not limited to unedited local recordings of attempts and world save files) upon request during the run’s verification process. Refusal to comply may result in rejection. World files, logs, etc. are always appreciated to be linked but are not required unless specified for category rules or if requested by verifiers.  
A.7.2.a) Guidance: Please don't delete anything until your run has been verified; it may be useful to help ensure its legitimacy. If you have any questions, please open a ticket in the Discord immediately after your run so we may get in contact with you to help assist you in providing any evidence you need.  
A.7.3) Additional proof of runs must be viewable.   
This excludes but is not limited to:  
A.7.3.a) Private files  
A.7.3.b) Deleted files  
A.7.4) Files submitted must not be modified or altered.  
A.7.4.a) Exception: Pre-1.9 logs contain the player access token, which may be edited out. If you choose to do this, you should mention that the logs were modified in the files submission.  
A.7.4.b) Guidance: It is highly recommended to submit all files prior to loading any illegal mods or datapacks. For this reason, it is discouraged to submit files while playing with mods that load additional datapacks (such as MCSR Ranked).  
Entangled Rule(s):  
A.7.4 is referenced by: [A.12.1.d](#bookmark=id.9vl2pzs7ucst)  
A.7.5) World files refer to the full folder with the world’s name as the folder's name in the .minecraft/saves folder.  
A.7.6) Logs refer to the .log/.gz file in the .minecraft/logs folder. These files will be named according to the dates on which they were generated. Submit the run with the log(s) which contains information about the run in question. If you are unsure which session has your run, submit logs for that entire day and also the log with the name "latest.log".   
A.7.6.a) Guidance: At midnight (local computer time), a new log file is created by the game. If you are in the world when this occurs, please be sure to include the complete set of logs for the lifetime of the instance, from game launch to world close.  
Entangled Rule(s):  
A.7.6 is referenced by: [A.3.1.b](#bookmark=id.x9eaxn5t1smd)  
A.7.7) Evidence of past attempts refers to videos of previously completed runs, nearly completed runs, practice sessions, or session videos. These should be in the same category of the run.  
A.7.8) 5 previous world files does not include the world files of the submitted run: this will generally mean you submit 6 world files in total. These should be from the same instance.  
A.7.8.a)  If SeedQueue is used and 5 previous world files must be sent, all world files generated after the run must also be submitted.  
A.7.9) Gameplay audio may be submitted either through the main submission video or a linked separate video. The entire run’s audio should be included.  
A.7.10) In the rare circumstance that a run must go through immediate moderator notifications, please open a thread and ping moderators by submitting a message with @LeaderboardMod, with your Minecraft instances still open and while still recording.

A.9.2) If multiple instances of Minecraft are being used, each instance must be recorded, either in the main recording or in a separate recording submitted as additional proof.   
A.9.2.a) Exception: If the criteria of [A.2.5.c](#bookmark=id.rjbh70a9yekg) are met (playing with Atum, SpeedrunIGT, and showing the F3 screen prior to leaving the world), only the instance which the player plays must be recorded.  
A.9.3) If each instance must be recorded (i.e. they are not subject to the exception of A.9.2.a), the video of the instances that are in the background or not currently being played do not have to follow as strict criteria as [A.2.8](#bookmark=id.yvm68duceuvw). However, they must meet the following requirements:  
A.9.3.a) The text on the percentage on the loading screen should be legible, along with the chunkmap which shows the world being generated.  
A.9.3.b) To follow A.9.3.a, if the default video’s percentage text is illegible, runners may zoom in on the chunk map and percentage text. If WorldPreview 2.3.3 is used, this must capture both the initial text/chunkmap in the centre of the screen, along with the text and chunkmap when it jumps to the bottom left when the WorldPreview begins. The rest of the screen should also still be included.

	This includes but is not limited to:  
	A.12.1.a) Using illegal mods/datapacks to achieve more favourable situations in-game  
A.12.1.b) Using a disallowed program to attempt to gain information about a world being speedrun

A.12.1.e) Attempting to pass off another person's run as your own  
A.12.1.f) Using illegal macros to emulate human movement  
A.12.2) Any illegitimate behaviour in a submitted run is grounds for rejection of the run.  
A.12.3) If a player intentionally engages in illegitimate behaviour in a submitted run, all of their previous and future runs will be rejected.  
A.12.3.a) Exception: Co-op runs may remain verified if it can be determined (at the discretion of verifiers) that no cheating occurred.  
A.12.3.b) Exception: A player may appeal their inability to have future runs verified by opening a thread in the official Discord server. They may be exempt from having future runs rejected at the discretion of moderators. If they are exempt, however, they may have additional proof burdens put onto any/all of their future runs.

A.12.note) Illegitimate behaviour is distinguished from disallowed behaviour (behaviour which results in a run's rejection, but not any future/retroactive punishment) on a case by case basis. These distinguishing factors include (but are not limited to) the perceived intent of the player, whether or not the player attempted to hide said behaviour or deceive others, if the behaviour in question later becomes allowed, and the extent/impact of the illegitimate behaviour.

# **B: Random Seed Ruleset** {#b:-random-seed-ruleset}

## **B.1: Generation and Post-Run Requirements** {#b.1:-generation-and-post-run-requirements}

B.1.1) Random seed runs must leave the seed input box entirely blank. (in Atum’s config menu if generated by Atum and in the Create New World screen if generated by Vanilla means)  
B.1.2) You should do /seed after the run and showcase this within the video.  
B.1.2.a) Clarification: This must only be done once the run’s objective is complete, not during the run.

## **B.2: Seed Visibility** {#b.2:-seed-visibility}

B.2.1) In versions prior to 1.3, the F3 screen, which displays the seed, must not be displayed before or during the run.

C.2.1) Exception to [A.10.5](#bookmark=id.j143q7f31vzn): Macros may read the game’s log files to ascertain the player’s spawn coordinates prior to the run’s start. The macro may use this information to choose to reset the world without player input.

# **D: Glitchless Ruleset** {#d:-glitchless-ruleset}

## **D.1: Glitchless Runs** {#d.1:-glitchless-runs}

D.1.note) Glitches are only allowed in glitchless on a case-by-case basis. What differentiates a glitch from a technique is nebulous, but is generally defined by if it can be done unintentionally. In terms of legalising a glitch, it is generally done by the mod team’s discretion of how severely they stray from the “spirit of the game” as seen by the general Minecraft community, whether they make the speedruns more or less fun to play, and how easy it is to perform accidentally. In general, one should err on the side of caution in terms of if something is a glitch or a technique; it is highly encouraged to open a thread and ask if a technique quantifies as a glitch, and if not, if it will be allowed in glitchless runs.

D.1.1) Only these glitches may be used during glitchless runs.

D.1.3.b) Exception: Runners may Save and Quit within a run intentionally if and only if there is a relevant bug (at the discretion of verifiers) which can be resolved by saving and quitting (ex. pie chart bug, ghost blocks, resetting fog, restarting autosave timer to avoid leads breaking). No additional benefit may be gained.  
D.1.3.c) If a Save and Quit is deemed as permissible and the run qualifies for a top-level retime, any time spent outside of the world will be included in the in-game time, but any time spent waiting for loads will not be included in the in-game time.

E.1.2) The FastReset quit button (menu.quitWorld) must not be used during the run.  
E.1.2.a) If menu.quitWorld is used during the run, it may still be verified if it is determined to not affect the run (at the discretion of verifiers).  
E.1.3) If you use Task Manager or another program which forcefully closes the game, you should include a video of this during the run.  
E.1.4) External Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE) must not be used.

E.2.1) All time spent in-game will be included in the final in-game time of glitched runs.  
E.2.1.a) Clarification: If the game is reverted to a previous state, time spent in that later (now discarded) state will still contribute towards the final time, despite the fact that the playOneMinute statistic does not include this time.  
E.2.2) Glitched runs follow the same hierarchy of timers as is outlined in [A.5](#bookmark=id.s9xaud4bhklt), with the following additions:  
E.2.2.a) You should use SpeedrunIGT; for this to be used as your primary timing method, the autosave interval in the timer section must be set to ticks.  
E.2.2.b) Times may be adjusted from other timers to follow E.2.1.

**E.3: Internal Runs**  
E.3.1) Internal runs must not leave the world (Save and Quit or crash the game) in accordance with glitchless rules [D.1.3](#bookmark=id.mjw1q0inxd8v)\-[D.1.4](#bookmark=id.z13l4cueku7w).

**E.4: External Runs**  
E.4.1) External runs must leave the world (Save and Quit or crash the game).  
E.4.1.a) Clarification: Runs are not considered external if the only time(s) in which the world is/are left are circumstances that would still be allowed under a glitchless/internal context (i.e. if the circumstances are in accordance with [D.1.3](#bookmark=id.mjw1q0inxd8v)\-[D.1.4](#bookmark=id.z13l4cueku7w)).

F.1.3) No cheats or actions which could not be accomplished without cheats must be used during the run.  
F.1.3.a) Exception: /difficulty may be used, nullifying [A.3.5](#bookmark=id.5il6rk51l0p0) (note that in accordance with [A.3.11](#bookmark=id.67uie2vqk7x1), the difficulty must not be set to peaceful, even if toggling between difficulties)  
F.1.3.b) Exception: /time set 0 may be used as described in [F.2.2](#bookmark=id.xi3p5kmrcb6e), nullifying [A.3.5](#bookmark=id.5il6rk51l0p0).

	F.1.7.b) Spigot  
	F.1.7.c) CraftBukkit  
	F.1.7.d) BungeeCord

F.1.note) Co-op runs are given more leniency due to being less competitive and more difficult to organise. If an error is made either with the run or in the submission, you should still submit, and the run may be verified (at the discretion of verifiers).

## **F.2: Co-op Timing Rules** {#f.2:-co-op-timing-rules}

F.2.1) Runs done on LAN may start their time following the same rules as [A.5.1](#bookmark=id.7y95l5ma4cgn)/[A.5.2](#bookmark=id.luqwca4pp8ef) (world load/first input).  
F.2.2) Runs done on external servers or runs on LAN which choose to do so will start their time upon the entering of the command /time set 0\.  
F.2.2.a) Please do not wait excessively long to run the command after the server is launched.  
F.2.2.b) If this timing method is chosen, inputs which would normally start timing (as defined by [A.5.2](#bookmark=id.luqwca4pp8ef)) must not occur prior to the entering of the command.  
F.2.2.b.i) Exception to [A.5.2.a](#bookmark=id.myaowilcg1vw): Players being pushed by mobs before the time set command will not be considered as starting the run unless a significant advantage is gained (at the discretion of verifiers).  
F.2.2.c) Clarification: Once /time set 0 is done once to start timing, it cannot be used again for the rest of the run.  
Entangled Rule(s):  
F.2.2 is referenced by: [F.1.3.b](#bookmark=id.yhavtnv8w9t)  
F.2.3) On external servers, if /time set 0 is not done, then time starts when the server loads the world. If the server being launched isn't shown on video, world files and/or logs will be requested.

## **F.3: Video Rules** {#f.3:-video-rules}

F.3.1) Every player should record their perspective, and all of these perspectives should be submitted with the run.   
F.3.1.a) Clarification: Unless otherwise specified, no other perspectives beyond those outlined in F.3.2-F.3.4 are necessary to be recorded.   
F.3.2) The first player to join the server must be recording.

	CE1.1.2.a) Example: If a boss suffocates to death purely as a result of world generation, it is not considered killed.  
CE1.1.3) Runs must show that the boss is killed.  
	This constitutes at least one of the following:  
	CE1.1.3.a) The death is shown in the video
